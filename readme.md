# Project Context

I have to build a Symphony project for school and was asked that it contains:
- user sessions / login - logout
- a DB with crud fonctions
- search form 

# Project Title

My website is for boardgamers who want to subscribe to a boardgame club. It will be possible for them to consult their events, their game libraries and subscribe to a game session.

## Features

What I want:

MVP1: Events features: crud and subscription to an event
MVP2: Subscribe a club and members management
MVP3: Manage boardgame Library
MVP4: Create and subscribe to a game session

## Dependencies

### Webpack

### Calendar JS
Calendar doc: 
- https://fullcalendar.io/docs/date-display

https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html?path=/docs/about-big-calendar--page

### Leaflet for openstreetMap

- https://leafletjs.com/

with plugins: 
- MapTiler ( for geocoding)
- Leaflet MarkerCluster (not working for the moment) 

### Vich uploader
https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle

## The project now

For now, only the MVP1 features are implemented. I pushed them a lot further that I initially thought because I wanted my MVP1 to be as complete as possible so all the other features would be "bonuses". 

## The project tomorrow

- A lot of the project is for admin users, so I want to develop a back office Interface with easy admin 4. It will really improve the UX. I didn't do it before because, as a learner, it was asked from me to build everything "from scratch". 

- Add features for the map search:
    1. geolocalisation (https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
    2. Searchbar in the map
    3. Bugfix for clusters marker

- Sync the personal event calendar with a google calendar.

- to be able to send a mail (if wanted) when a user subscribes to an event or when an event is cancelled

- add boardgame Clubs
